Welcome to GRACE Viewer's documentation!
========================================

The GRACE Viewer is a web-application developed in the Tethys Development Framework. It allows users to view output from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE). You can find more information about GRACE here https://grace.jpl.nasa.gov/

This app has an interface that allows for subsetting regions. This feature is made possible through the Satellite Hydrology Bits Analysis And Mapping (SHBAAM) python toolbox. The SHBAAM code is available at https://github.com/c-h-david/shbaam
